 * Why we are able to see protected variable i from class X ?
 * <p>
 * What will be printed out, then fixed ?
 * <p>
 * Ans.: 1. X class is package private, we instantiate new X class - x instance with all class fields and methods
 * 2. methodOfX is private in class X, private methods can only be accessed from within the same class
 * 3. method 'methodOfx' should be either public or protected
